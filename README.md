# Personal-Cover-Letter-Generator

### Purpose: 

Automating my process of writing cover letters so I can focus on what I like about each specific company and how I meet their specific requirements. This also ensures that I follow my own guidelines consistently and minimizes human error for the date and company name entry.

### Languages used: 

HTML, CSS, JavaScript (w/ Node.JS) 

### APIs used:

OpenAI

### What is Specifically Addressed?

The date, introduction, conclusion, any repeated company and position name entries and their corresponding prefixes, and the placing of the three body paragraphs (which will be generated as placeholder text in the word document using openAI while following instructions that generally apply to each application which will be further edited and personally re-written) and are then automatically organized.

### What Parts are There?

Part 1: The Sample Cover Letter Option

This is a button that uses sample data to generate a Cover Letter (.docx) to test my code.

Part 2: The Tailored Cover Letter Option

This is a form where I submit the position, company name, what I like about the company, and the key job languages and requirements which generates a cover letter (.docx) using this information.

### How does this save time?

Once I enter the information to the form and submit, I only need to briefly look over and edit the three body paragraphs to ensure that they are consistent with my guidlines and then export to PDF so I can use it for my application while resting assured that all the information was entered and formatted correctly.
